# Financial Calculators Suite - Summary
This suite provides two simple web-based financial calculators and a central navigation page:

## 1. Mutual Funds Comparison Calculator: 

Helps compare two mutual funds based on income tax slab, investment amount, expected returns, and STCG/LTCG tax rates. It calculates various tax scenarios and identifies the best fund based on after-tax returns for different categories.

## 2. Inflation Adjusted Amount Calculator: 

Determines the future value of an amount adjusted for inflation and calculates the monthly investment (SIP) needed to reach that future financial goal, considering an expected return on investment. The period can be specified in years or months.

## Financial Calculators Hub: 

A central index.html page linking to both calculators, designed for easy navigation and responsiveness across all devices.
